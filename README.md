# PieLab

PieLab is an interdisciplinary research group dedicated
to the development of experimental pies. Our expert 
researchers apply the latest findings in crust tectonics, 
filling dynamics, and computational flakeometry to engineer
more perfect pies.

At PieLab, we're not just pushing the frontiers of pie science.
We're baking the pies of tomorrow, today.

(This is a very simple blog engine I wrote to learn Rails, and will
also be a real website soon. A live demo is available [here](https://pielab.herokuapp.com/))
